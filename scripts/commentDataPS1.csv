"There's this really cool thing you can do with testing to make testing code more DRY, which is to write a harness - it's a method that takes in your inputs and expected outputs, and does all the actual assertions itself. that way your test cases are just different sets of in/outputs that you pass to the harness. That said, your test code is pretty well organized already, so it's up to you if you want to implement it.",erosolar (S),azrahman,ExtractTest (ps1),https://10.18.6.30/chunks/view/95320#comment-210581,2015-03-01 16:38:08,"There's this really cool thing you can do with testing to make testing code more DRY, which is to write a harness - it's a method that takes in your inputs and expected outputs, and does all the actual assertions itself. that way your test cases are just different sets of in/outputs that you pass to the harness.

It would also be nice to use variables to label what the xCoords.get(i) and yCoords.get(i) are so it makes sense to the code reader (e.g int targetX = xCoords.get(i) and int targetY = yCoords.get(i)),calvinli (T),huypham,TurtleSoup (ps0),https://10.18.6.30/chunks/view/90616#comment-206002,2015-02-12 20:35:06,It would also be nice to use variables to label what the xCoords.get(i) and xCoords.get(i+1) are so it makes sense to the code reader (e.g int currentX = xCoords.get(i) and int targetX = xCoords.get(i+1)) That would also shorten the length of the line,calvinli (T),jorenl,TurtleSoup (ps0),https://10.18.6.30/chunks/view/89919#comment-205954,2015-02-12 20:17:03
