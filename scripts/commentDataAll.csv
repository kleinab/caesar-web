"After you write the rep invariant, there are two sides to making sure that it is preserved. The checkRep method is your way of making sure that YOUR code does not invalidate the rep invariant: you should call it at the end of every method that might change the value of a field to make sure that the field's new value is still valid. Clients, on the other hand, cannot see your rep invariant, and maintaining it is not their responsibility. To prevent clients from invalidating the rep invariant, our only option is to prevent them from ever having the power to change the fields except in ways that we expect, through this class's methods, where we have the power to control what happens to the fields and verify that their values are always valid. This is where the safety from rep exposure argument comes in: you must convince yourself, us, and any future maintainer of this code that no client ever gets the power to modify the fields where we cannot verify their values. Some examples of how this might happen are if a client passes in a mutable object and you save a reference to it to a field (the client can still access it and modify its value), one of your methods returns a mutable object that is saved as a field (that client can now modify your field directly).
